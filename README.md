## NAME

Power::Outlet - Control and query network attached power outlets

## SYNOPSIS

Command Line

    power-outlet Config    ON section "My Section"
    power-outlet iBoot     ON host mylamp
    power-outlet Hue       ON host mybridge id 1 username myuser
    power-outlet Shelly    ON host myshelly
    power-outlet SonoffDiy ON host mysonoff
    power-outlet Tasmota   ON host mytasmota
    power-outlet WeMo      ON host mywemo

Perl Object API

    my $outlet=Power::Outlet->new(                   #sane defaults from manufactures spec
                                  type => "iBoot",
                                  host => "mylamp",
                                 );
    print $outlet->query, "\n";
    print $outlet->on, "\n";
    print $outlet->off, "\n";

## DESCRIPTION

Power::Outlet is a package for controlling and querying network attached power outlets.  Individual hardware drivers in this name space must provide a common object interface for the controlling and querying of an outlet.  Common methods that every network attached power outlet must know are on, off, query, switch and cycle.  Optional methods might be implemented in some drivers like amps and volts.

### SCOPE

The current scope of these packages is network attached power outlets. I started with iBoot and iBootBar since I had the hardware.  Hardware configuration is beyond the scope of this group of packages as most power outlets have functional web based or command line configuration tools.

### Home Assistant

Integration with Home Assistant [https://home-assistant.io/](https://home-assistant.io/) can be acomplished by configuring a Command Line Switch. 

    switch:
      - platform: command_line
        switches:
          ibootbar_1:
            command_on: /usr/bin/power-outlet iBootBar ON host mybar.local outlet 1
            command_off: /usr/bin/power-outlet iBootBar OFF host mybar.local outlet 1
            command_state: /usr/bin/power-outlet iBootBar QUERY host mybar.local outlet 1 | /bin/grep -q ON
            friendly_name: My iBootBar Outlet 1

See [https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.command\_line/](https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.command_line/)

### Node Red

Integration with Node Red [https://nodered.org/](https://nodered.org/) can be acomplished with the included JSON web API power-outlet-json.cgi.  The power-outlet-json.cgi script is a layer on top of [Power::Outlet::Config](https://metacpan.org/pod/Power::Outlet::Config) where the "name" parameter maps to the section in the /etc/power-outlet.ini INI file.

To acces all of these devices use an http request node with a URL https://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/power-outlet-json.cgi?name={{topic}};action={{payload}} then simply set the topic to the INI section and the action to either ON or OFF.

## USAGE

The Perl one liner

    perl -MPower::Outlet -e 'print Power::Outlet->new(type=>"Tasmota", host=>shift)->switch, "\n"' myhost

The included command line script

    power-outlet Shelly ON host myshelly

## CONSTRUCTOR

### new

    my $outlet = Power::Outlet->new(type=>"WeMo",     host=>"mywemo");

# File: scripts/power-outlet.cgi

## NAME

power-outlet.cgi - Control multiple Power::Outlet devices from web browser

## DESCRIPTION

power-outlet.cgi is a CGI application to control multiple Power::Outlet devices.  It was written to work on iPhone and look ok in most browsers.

## CONFIGURATION

To add an outlet for the CGI application, add a new INI section to the power-outlet.ini file.

    [Unique_Section_Name]
    type=iBoot
    host=Lamp
    groups=Inside
    groups=Kitchen

If you need to override the defaults

    [Unique_Section_Name]
    type=iBoot
    host=Lamp
    port=80
    pass=PASS
    name=My iBoot Description
    groups=Outside
    groups=Deck

WeMo device

    [WeMo]
    type=WeMo
    host=mywemo
    groups=Inside
    groups=Study

Default Location: /usr/share/power-outlet/conf/power-outlet.ini

## BUILD

    rpmbuild -ta Power-Outlet-*.tar.gz

## INSTALLATION

I recommend installation with the provided RPM package perl-Power-Outlet-application-cgi which installs to /usr/share/power-outlet and configures Apache with /etc/httpd/conf.d/power-outlet.conf.

    sudo yum install perl-Power-Outlet-application-cgi

# File: scripts/power-outlet-json.cgi

## NAME

power-outlet-json.cgi - Control Power::Outlet device with JSON web service (e.g. Node-Red)

## DESCRIPTION

power-outlet-json.cgi is a CGI application to control a Power::Outlet device with a web service.

## API

The script is called over HTTP with name and action parameters.  The name is the Section Name from the INI file and the action is one of on, off, query, or switch.

    http://localhost/power-outlet/power-outlet-json.cgi?name=Lamp;action=off
    http://localhost/power-outlet/power-outlet-json.cgi?name=Lamp;action=on
    http://localhost/power-outlet/power-outlet-json.cgi?name=Lamp;action=query

Return is a JSON hash with keys status and state.  status is OK if there are no errors, state is the state of the switch after command either ON or OFF.

    {"status":"OK","state":"ON"}

## Node-Red Integration

Use three nodes: inject, http request, and debug.

- In the inject node
    - Set the "Topic" to the desired INI config file \[section\] name.
    - Set the "Payload" to one of "ON", "OFF", "QUERY" or "SWITCH"
- In the http request node
    - Set the "Method" to GET (script also supports POST)
    - Set the "URL" to https://127.0.0.1/power-outlet/power-outlet-json.cgi?name={{topic}};action={{payload}}
    - Set the "Return" to a parsed JSON Object
- In the debug node
    - Set the "Output" to msg.payload.state which returns "ON" or "OFF"

# File: scripts/power-outlet-mqtt-listener.pl

## NAME

power-outlet-mqtt-listener.pl - MQTT listener to control Power::Outlet devices

## SYNOPSIS

    power-outlet-mqtt-listener.pl [-c /etc/power-outlet-mqtt-listener.yml]

## DESCRIPTION

This script provides an MQTT listener to control Power::Outlet devices

## CONFIGURATION

The YAML formatted file /etc/power-outlet-mqtt-listener.yml is a key-value hash.  

The "host" key value is a string representing the host name of the MQTT server.

The "directives" key value is a list of individual directives with "name", "topic", "value" (topic payload to match) and "actions".

The "actions" key value is a list of individual actions to run when "topic" and "value" match. Individual actions have keys "name", "driver", "command", and "options". "options" is a hash of options that is passed to the driver.

Example:

    ---
    host: mqtt

    directives:

    - name: Smart Outlet Top Button Press
      topic: cmnd/smartoutlet_button_topic/POWER1
      value: TOGGLE
      actions:
      - name: Outside Lights
        driver: iBootBarGroup
        command: 'ON'
        options:
          outlets: '1,2,6,7'
          host: bar

    - name: Smart Outlet Bottom Button Press
      topic: cmnd/smartoutlet_button_topic/POWER2
      value: TOGGLE
      actions:
      - name: Outside Lights
        driver: iBootBarGroup
        command: 'OFF'
        options:
          outlets: '1,2,6,7'
          host: bar
